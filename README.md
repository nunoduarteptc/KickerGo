Playground on GO 

- Use a API to receive a message on "REST API"(in the future)
- Use go routines to create another API for websockets


Ideas to test:

- GIN Framework (maybe on another repo)
- Use a channel between APIs
- Use other Websocket package (Gorilla/websocket is in maintenance)
- Use Redis between APIs
